# Restaurant-Review-Analyser-Deployment

The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative.
A Naive Bayes algorithm was used to build a binary classification model that would predict if the reviewâ€™s sentiment was positive or negative. A Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. It uses the training data to calculate a probability of each outcome based on the features

## Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv is a dataset from Kaggle datasets which consists of 1000 reviews on a restaurant
